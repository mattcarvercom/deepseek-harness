// read_image toolview registrant: the keyed toolview hole for the read_image
// tool. The row composes the shared read-family assembly and feeds it the durable
// image reference as ToolRow's `image` card material, so the image renders through
// the Tool-owned `tool.call.images` gallery — whose dispatcher the chat node hands
// down in owner props — inside the collapsed-by-default expanded body. The
// attachment presentation plugin fills that gallery; the tool layer only ever
// supplies the references and the session-authorized loader it received from the
// chat node.
//
// Claiming the `read_image` key suppresses the generic fallback for EVERY
// read_image result, so this component must cover all of the tool's shapes, not
// only the happy one: a running call (no result yet), a settled image, a refusal
// (a text-only route, a missing attachment service, an unreadable file), and a
// cancelled call. Each of those settles without an `image` card, and the row falls
// back to its text body for them.
//
// Like the read card, the image card is result-side only: a call carries no
// content until `execute` returns, so a running read_image shows the summary row
// alone.
